"Description": "This session is intended as an introduction to Node.js, a hot open-source technology increasingly gaining popularity within the developer community. Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that enables fast, scalable, real-time network applications written in JavaScript. We'll talk about what node.js is, how it works, and its best use cases. As well as talking about node.js itself, we'll also discuss the community surrounding it, and some of the powerful modules created to enhance or simplify its capabilities, such as Express and Socket.io. Finally, we'll go through some brief code examples to show just how easy it is to leverage node.js in your projects.",

"Description": "Software developers are writers. Our medium is text. What can we learn about how to write better code by studying the practices of prose authors? Frequently in software development, we solve a problem, check in the code and release it. Unfortunately, this means that we release the first draft of our solution. One of the main lessons of writing workshops and classes is to write in small chunks and revise ruthlessly. By releasing our first drafts, we increase the maintenance cost of our application by making it harder for the next developer to understand the initial intent of the our solution. In this session, we will explore concepts from the craft of writing such as small assignments, shi**y first drafts, where ideas come from and the three types of drafts as they apply to the practice of software development.",

But how about language that takes JavaScript's good parts, cleans up the syntax a little bit, adds lexical scope to variables<br />(which prevents accidental pollution of the global namespace),  makes function binding easier, and integrates with existing JavaScript libraries?<br /><br />Meet CoffeeScript, an open source language that has been around for 2+ years and provides these features.<br /><br />This session is an introduction to CoffeeScript, the main features of the language, how is different from JavaScript, why is important to web developers, and how you can integrate it in your web site today.",

"SessionTitle": "Asynchronous Javascript - callbacks are so old school",
"Description": "Javascript developers can't get enough of callbacks.  It's been our tried and true workhorse when dealing with asynchronous code since the dawn of ajax. With the advent of nodejs, we've taken things to the extreme. Now, if we want to make a database query, respond to a web server request, or make a rest call to a web service, we need deeply nested callbacks in order to achieve what we need. In time, this phenomenon becomes the pyramid of doom, where we need 500 character of horizontal screen width to read all of our code.<br /><br />The issue here isn't that we are using asynchronous code, but rather that we aren't using the best design pattern for the job. I'd like to talk through a relatively new paradigm for control flow in javascript, the promise. Using this technique, you can develop an much more straightforward asynchronous javascript application. Not only is it a way to remove the need for callbacks, but it opens a door to new design possibilities, without the complexity of continuation passing style. Rather than passing all of our callbacks as arguments, we will take a higher level, and more functional approach, by creating a system that expects promise objects to eventually produce data, and we manipulate that data expecting that it will exist in the future.<br /><br />//notes<br />This talk can be targeted at either nodejs, or jQuery, or a hybrid of both. jQuery has a slightly different and non standard implementation of promises, but I could easily cover both and smooth over the differences. For me, it just depends on what people are predominantly interested in.",

Using a SQL and JSON based language to declare API calls, interdependencies, forks and joins, filtering and projections, app developers are able to cut down the amount of effort required to integrate multiple APIs from hundreds of lines of code down to a few. Besides the language itself, ql.io can be deployed as a stand-alone server, allowing you to deploy it as an HTTP gateway between client apps and API servers to have ql.io process and condense the data to just the fields that the client needs.",

In their day to day, developers don't need to worry about all of these smaller issues .Chances are, a javascript developer has encountered these difficult issues, learned the solution, and then immediately absorbed the concepts.<br /><br />I'm going to explain to you, the real three \"bad\" parts of the language. These are the three javascript specific features that are the most likely to trip up a javascript developer.  Once you innately understand these three issues, you will become significantly more productive in javascript, and will be a lot less confused when reading through large javascript code bases.<br /><br />I'll be walking you through three concepts within javascript semantics:<br />1) What on earth does \"this\" mean?<br />2) How does prototypical inheritance work?<br />3) What's the difference between a function expression and function declaration, and why do I care?",
